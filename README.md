# Amazon-Review-Text-Sentiment-Analysis
Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Kindle Reviews project! The primary aim of this project was to develop and evaluate models for sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon Kindle reviews. The project employs two types of models: a regular model and an attention model, both of which successfully predict sentiment expressed in review texts with high accuracy.

# Project Overview
In this repository, we delve into sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques on a curated dataset of Amazon Kindle reviews. Our primary focus lies on two distinct models:

Regular Model: We designed and trained a regular sentiment analysis model that accurately predicts the sentiment conveyed in the review texts.
Attention Model: Additionally, we explored an attention-based sentiment analysis model to further enhance prediction accuracy and analyze the significance of different parts of the text.
#Model Evaluation
The effectiveness of both models was thoroughly evaluated using various performance metrics, including:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC)

Notably, both models demonstrated impressive results:

- Regular Model Accuracy: 79%
- Attention Model Accuracy: 80%

  
AUC-ROC Analysis: Both models exhibit favorable performance, surpassing the threshold of being more accurate than inaccurate.
